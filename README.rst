**pyhound** is a command-line client for the `Hound`_ source code search
engine. It connects to a Hound server.

Requirements
============

**pyhound** requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 or 3.4.


Installation
============

**pyhound** needs a Hound server. See Hound documentation for further
details. The steps below assume that you have a Hound server listening
(for example on ``http://localhost:6080``).

To install **pyhound**, use ``pip``:

    pip install pyhound


Features
========

**pyhound** aims to output search results in the manner of ``grep``
and hence implement some (but definitely not all) of its options.

The main feature of **pyhound** is its ``--help`` argument::

    usage: hound [-h] [--version] [--endpoint URL] [--repos REPOSITORY_LIST]
                 [--exclude-repos REPOSITORY_LIST] [--path FILE_PATH_PATTERN]
                 [-A NUM] [-B NUM] [-C NUM] [--color [WHEN]] [-i] [-n]
                 PATTERN
    
    A command-line client for Hound.
    
    positional arguments:
      PATTERN               The regular expression to search.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      --endpoint URL        Host and port of the Hound server. You may also set a
                            HOUND_ENDPOINT environment variable. Default:
                            http://localhost:6080/
      --repos REPOSITORY_LIST
                            A comma-separated list of repositories to search in.
                            Default: all.
      --exclude-repos REPOSITORY_LIST
                            A comma-separated list of repositories to exclude.
      --path FILE_PATH_PATTERN
                            A pattern to match against the path of candidate
                            files.
      -A NUM, --after-context NUM
                            Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching
                            lines. Cannot be used with -C.
      -B NUM, --before-context NUM
                            Print NUM lines of leading context before matching
                            lines. Cannot be used with -C.
      -C NUM, --context NUM
                            Print NUM lines of output context. Cannot be used with
                            -A or -B.
      --color [WHEN], --colour [WHEN]
                            Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, file names,
                            line numbers and separators (for fields and groups of
                            context lines) with escape sequences to display them
                            in color on the terminal. WHEN may be "never",
                            "always" or "auto".
      -i, --ignore-case     Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the
                            input files.
      -n, --line-number     Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line
                            number within its input file.


Status
======

**pyhound** is considered beta. It's only a few lines long and seems
to work. However, it's still very new and has not seen much diverse
usage yet.

Amongst other things, there is no error handling yet. Hopefully,
Python tracebacks should be explicit. :)


Alternatives
============

Hound itself provides a command-line client but it seemed a bit
slowish and the ``grep``-like output has not been implemented (though
there is a TODO comment there so it may be planned).


The name
========

I must apologize. It's the first time I write a Python package that
starts with "py". I thought I could resist a few years more. How naive
of me...
